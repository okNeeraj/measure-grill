// I want to design a database from below JSON with below instruction -
// 	1. Inside lighthouseResult -> I have two Objects Audits and Categories
// 2. Inside Audits -> Multiple recoreds added with key like paste - preventing - inputs, network - rtt etc.
// 3. Inside each category -> auditRefs contain all key in id, which is key of audit
// 4. No.of audit can be more than 1000 its not predictable
// 5. AuditRefs also can be many
